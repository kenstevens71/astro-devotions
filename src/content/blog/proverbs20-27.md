(Pro 20:27)  The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, searching all his innermost parts.


"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In Him was Life: eternal 
Life. God has given to all who believe in Christ Jesus, His own abundant Life. And he who has the Son 
has the Life of Christ within. That Life of Christ is the Light of men that shines in our heart, 
searching the innermost parts of our being.

God created man in His own image with a spirit, soul, and body, and the human spirit is that distinctive element that separates humanity from other creatures. The human spirit is born dead in trespasses and sins, but once the Life and Light of Christ has flooded into our hearts by grace through faith in Him, we become His hands to help, His feet to go, His heart to love, and His Light to shine forth His Life in our human frame.

The human spirit is God's lamp in a dark world of sin and suffering. We are not created with the capacity to shine ourselves - only the Light of Christ within our regenerated human spirit (our new born-again life in Christ), can illumine the spirit of man and shed light in a dark world.

The lamp is not that Light of God, but the vessel through which the Light of Christ may shine, illuminating our hearts and shining forth the Light of Christ and the Love of God to a lost and dying world.

But before we can be used effectively by Him, we should welcome His inner scrutiny into our inner being and willingly submit to His searching our hearts, our hidden thoughts, and our secret motives so that we may be fit vessels to shine forth His Light to others.
