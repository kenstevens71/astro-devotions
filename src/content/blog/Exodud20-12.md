(Exo 20:12)  “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD 
your God is giving you.


(Exo 20:12)  “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD 
your God is giving you.


Honor your father and your mother. The key to societal stability is reverence and respect 
for parents and their authority. The appended promise primarily related the command to life 
in the Promised Land and reminded the Israelite of the program God had set up for him and his 
people. Within the borders of their territory, God expected them not to tolerate juvenile 
delinquency, which at heart is overt disrespect for parents and authority. Severe 
consequences, namely capital punishment, could apply (cf. Deu_21:18-21). One of the reasons 
for the Babylonian exile was a failure to honor parents (Ezk_22:7, Ezk_22:15). 
The apostle Paul individualized this national promise when he applied the truth to believers 
in his day (cf. Mat_15:4; Mrk_7:10; Eph_6:1-3).

Honouring one's father and mother is being obedient to them, listening to
their advice, and complying with their instructions and wishes. This Old
Testament command, to honour your father and mother, is not only repeated by
the Lord Jesus in His pre-Cross ministry to Israel, but is also reiterated
to the Church by Paul, in both Ephesians and Colossians: "Children, be
obedient to your parents.. in the Lord, for this is right and well-pleasing
to the Lord."

Parents are a child's introduction to all types of authority and they help
to form their attitude towards the rule of law. The Lord has charged parents
to train up a child in the way that they should go, and help to shape
appropriate behaviours and attitudes towards other people and their
understanding of God, and His plan of salvation.

Obedience to one's father and mother teaches children to have a reverence
for God and respect for those in authority. It places the responsibility for
    the moral upbringing of children and their instruction in righteous
    living, firmly on the shoulders of the father and mother.

    When the commandment to honour one's parents was first given to Israel
    on Mount Sinai, it not only instructed a child towards obedience, but
    explained the positive outcome of honouring one's parents: "That your
    days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you."

    This is the fifth commandment that was given by Moses to the people of
    Israel and is the first command that comes with a promise. The promise
    of a long life that accompanies the honouring of one's parents, may not
    only refer to longevity of life in this age, but may also refer to the
    promises that God gave to Abraham, Isaac, David, and the nation of
    Israel.

    We read in Isaiah: "Thy dead shall live, and my dead body shall arise,
    awake and sing," while we read in Daniel: "And many of them that sleep
    in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some
    to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence." The Bible teaches that the
    land that was promised by God to the nation of Israel, will one day be
    fulfilled - when Christ returns to rule and reign as King of kings - and
    it is possible that His promise to prolong the days of those that honour
    their parents may be referring to this future time of peace and
    prosperity.

    However, it is the responsibility of all parents to teach their children
    the fear and nurture of the Lord, and it is the duty of all children to
    take this important instruction to heart... for those that reverence God
    by obeying His command to honour father and mother have the assurance
    that they will live long in the land which the Lord their God has given
    them.

    Not all fathers are God-fearing and not all mothers treat their children
    kindly, but being the child of bad or uncaring parents does not negate
    this commandment. We are not instructed to honour good parents but to
    dishonour bad ones. We are not directed to obey our parents if they are
    virtuous and deal responsibly with us, but disobey those who negate
    their God-given responsibility!

    Giving honour and respect to our father and mother is a command that
    should be obeyed irrespective of a parent's spiritual status - for this
    is right and well-pleasing to the Lord. Indeed, as Christians, we are
    not only required to honour our parents and submit to them, but to
    behave righteously with whomsoever we come in contact.

    When our vertical relationship is right with God, we discover that our
    horizontal relationship with parents and with others is also right - and
    vice versa.

    By God's perfect design we were placed in families. May we honour the
    father and mother who brought us into this world and those that
    influenced us in our lives for good. May we strive to walk in spirit and
    truth all the days of our life - and ensure that every day is lived in
    right relationship with our Heavenly Father - Who loves us so much that
    He sent His dearly loved Son to die on the Cross so that we might live
    in Him - by faith.
