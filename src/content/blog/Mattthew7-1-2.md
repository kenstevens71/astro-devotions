(Mat 7:1)  “Judge not, that you be not judged.

(Mat 7:2)  For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with
the measure you use it will be measured to you.



"Do not judge." What does it mean? Most Bible commentators agree that He is
 warning us about a faultfinding spirit, a negative attitude that causes us
 to pick at others for the things we do not like in them. A word that sums
 it up is criticism.

Criticism is a way of life for us, an integral part of our society. We have
movie critics, music critics, art critics, literary critics, sports critics,
dance critics, drama critics, and even wine critics. There are associations
of critics and award programs for critics. As a society, we seem to be
obsessed with criticizing the weaknesses and mistakes of others, living and
dead, convinced that it is the right thing to do. After all, it is our way
of life.


We try to remake our mates and shape up our children by criticism, and we bring that same
mentality into the church. We criticize others who do not measure up to our
expectations. Many find fault with church leaders for not doing things the
way we want them to be done. And we keep telling ourselves that it is the
right thing to do. After all, it is our way of life.


Why did Jesusus tell us not to point out in condemnation the faults of others? Is He
assuming that most of us have a tendency to do it? He knows our hearts, and
since it is one of the most common sins among Christians, He knows we all
need this reminder to some degree. Sometimes we are not even aware we are
harshly criticizing others because we have become so used to hearing it and
giving it. In fact, it can become such a common practice that we might
wonder what else there is to talk about other than constantly discussing the
flaws of others!

But why do we do it? One reason for criticizing others could bour own feelings of
inferiority, which surface in the form of pride. Attacking someone else is
flattering to ourselves; it makes us feel superior. If we can show others
where they fail to measure up, we feel we are a little smarter or better
than they are in that area.

Another reason could be envy or jealousy. We may be jealous because someone else is getting more 
attention than we are. Or we may envy someone's position or rank, thinking that we would be better 
at the job that they were given to do.

Why is criticism such a foolish habit? For one thing—and it is a big thing—criticism of this 
nature is sinful. It is the opposite of love because it arises out of impure motives. It attempts 
to emphasize one's own righteousness at the expense of someone else's reputation. On the other 
hand, love is reluctant to believe the worst and is hopeful of the best in others:

  Love is patient, love is kind, and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, 
  does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into 
  account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
  bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 
  (I Corinthians 13:4-7, New American Standard Version)


We criticize because of our impatience with others. Criticizing is certainly not being kind, 
and it is often provoked by envy and jealousy. We do it sometimes to exalt ourselves 
above others, which is arrogance. Criticism is unbecoming and rude. All of this is the 
opposite of love. The apostle Peter tells us that love seeks to conceal unrighteousness, 
not expose it (I Peter 4:8).

Another reason it is such a foolish habit is that it distorts our perspective. 
Satan is the originator of criticism. The first example of this is in the Garden 
of Eden, when Satan criticized God to Eve, which caused h`er perspective of God to be 
distorted, deceiving her into sin. Then Adam's perspective 
of God was also distorted, and he sinned. Man has been paying for it ever since.

Numbers 12 contains an example of how God reacts to the criticism of His anointed leader. 
"Then Mir`iam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman he had married" 
(Numbers 12:1, NET). The verb of this sentence, "spoke," is feminine, hinting that Miriam 
is the chief critic. Her condemnation of her brother, Moses, distorts Aaron's perspective of him, 
resulting in division in the family and the congregation. The siblings, envious of Moses' 
leadership, use another incident—his marriage to a Gentile—to criticize him. Often the immediate 
criticism is simply a surface issue covering a deeper matter, which comes out in verse 2: 
"They said, 'Has the LORD only spoken by Moses? Has he not also spoken by us?' And the LORD 
heard it."

God's reaction is swift and harsh (Numbers 12:5-11, 13-15). Miriam's criticism not only led her 
and Aaron to sin, but it also affected the entire camp, delaying the journey to the Promised Land. 
This should make us wonder: Does criticism within the church stunt our growth toward the Kingdom 
of God? It surely does, pitting brother against brother, producing division and offense, 
and perhaps causing a vulnerable brother to fall away.

Instead of criticizing others, we need to engage in some honest self-criticism. 
We have plenty of faults of our own; there is no need to look for them in others. 
So, whenever we are tempted to pick at a fault in someone else, we need to pray as 
David does in Psalm 139:23-24 (KJV): "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, 
and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the 
way everlasting."
