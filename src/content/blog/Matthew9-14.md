(Mat 8:14)  And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.

(Mar 1:30)  Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.

(Luk 4:38)  And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law 
was ill with a high fever, and they appealed to him on her behalf.



The mention of "Peter's wife's mother" proves that Peter was married. His wife was
likely still living, as Paul later asks in I Corinthians 9:5, "Do we have no
right to take along a believing wife, as do also the other apostles, the
brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?" This indicates that several of the
apostles were married during their ministries.

Erroneously, Roman Catholics claim Peter to be the rock on which the church
was built, the vicar of Christ, and the first Pope. How can they maintain,
then, that it is wrong for "priests" to marry? If this were a sin, why did
Christ not immediately reject Peter as an apostle, since he had a wife? It
seems incredible that the Catholic Church would teach that Peter was its
"first Pope," a model to all his successors, yet forbid its priests to marry
despite his being a married man!

Priestly celibacy is specifically contrary to New Testament teaching (I
Timothy 4:1, 3). Paul instructs, "A bishop then must be blameless, the
husband of one wife, . . . one who rules his own house well, having his
children in submission with all reverence (for if a man does not know how to
rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?)" (I Timothy
3:2, 4-5). Scripture makes no objection to God's ministers having a wife. As
Hebrews 13:4 declares, "Marriage is honorable among all."
