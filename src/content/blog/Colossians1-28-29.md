(Col 1:28)  Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, 
that we may present everyone mature in Christ.

(Col 1:29)  For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he
powerfully works within me.

1:28–29. Paul, in proclaiming this Christ who now also dwells in Gentile
believers was admonishing (nouthetountes, “counseling”) and teaching
(didaskontes, “instructing”) everyone (cf. 3:16). No doubt he did this
“admonishing” and instructing because of the false teaching about Christ in
Colosse. He did so wisely (cf. 4:5–6) since his purpose was not to drive
them into the hands of the heretics but to present everyone perfect
(teleion, “mature”; cf. James 1:4) in Christ. Paul was interested in
believers not remaining spiritual babies (cf. 1 Cor. 3:1–2) but in becoming
spiritually mature (cf. Heb. 5:11–14). Elsewhere Paul prayed for complete
sanctification of believers (1 Thes. 5:23). Paul preached the “fullness” of
the gospel so that believers could have the fullness of life Jesus promised
(John 10:10). To this end Paul expended all his God-given strength.
Developing maturity in believers took great labor (kopiō) or wearisome toil
(cf. 1 Cor. 15:10, 58; Gal. 4:11; 1 Thes. 1:3) and even struggling
(agōnizomenos; cf. Col. 2:1; 4:12) or agonizing like an athlete in an arena
(cf. 1 Cor. 9:25; 1 Tim. 6:12). The power for this struggle came from Christ
(cf. Phil. 4:13).
